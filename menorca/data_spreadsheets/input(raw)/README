These spreadsheets contain data used to model Menorca's power system and run the cost-optimization on Switch v2.0.

Several different sources were used to gather data and allow for the model construct.

It must be noted that the data in the spreadsheets is not yet fully formatted to be used with Switch. 
For all the (Switch-ready) input files used in the study, please check the folder "switch_files" two levels above this one.
